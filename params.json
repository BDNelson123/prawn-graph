  "body": "# Prawn::Graph - Easy Graphing for Prawn\r\n\r\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/prawn-graph.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/prawn-graph)\r\n[![License](http://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)](http://sujrd.mit-license.org)\r\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/HHRy/prawn-graph/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/HHRy/prawn-graph)\r\n[![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/HHRy/prawn-graph/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/HHRy/prawn-graph/coverage)\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HHRy/prawn-graph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HHRy/prawn-graph)\r\n[![security](https://hakiri.io/github/HHRy/prawn-graph/master.svg)](https://hakiri.io/github/HHRy/prawn-graph/master)\r\n![Maintained: yes](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained-yes-brightgreen.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn extension for the [prawn pdf library][5] which adds the ability to draw graphs (or charts if\r\nyou perfer) in PDF documents.\r\n\r\nBecause Prawn::Graph only uses the native PDF drawing functions exposed by Prawn, it removes the need to \r\ndepend on projects like Gruff to generate heavy PNG / JPG images of such graphs and charts and then include\r\nthose large blobs in your documents. The results may not be as pretty (yet), but the file-size differences \r\nare dramatic.\r\n\r\nBy default, graphs are drawn in monochrome, as that's likely how they will be printed. \r\n\r\nThis is free and open source software released under ther terms of the [MIT Licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n\r\nIts copyright is held by Ryan Stenhouse and the [other contributors][8] and it was first released in \r\n2010.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis gem is built assuming a Ruby version of 2.0 or higher. Older Ruby versions may work but are not \r\nofficially supported. We aim for compatibilty with 1.x and 2.x series of prawn. Any incomaptibilities\r\nwith prawn versions should be treated as bugs and added to the [issue tracker][2]. \r\n\r\nWe build automatically using Travis CI. Our [.travis.yml][9] file targets the same Ruby versions as\r\n[prawn itself][5] does.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Removed features:\r\n\r\nUnlike previous versions of `prawn-graph`, this version does not at this time include a theme api or the \r\nability to change the colors used to render the graph. \r\n\r\n### Removed deprecated methods\r\n\r\nThe `bar_chart`, `line_chart`, `bar_graph`, and `line_graph` methods have been removed. This means that this\r\nversion of prawn-graph is no-longer backwards compatible. If you _must_ use those old methods, then please \r\nuse version `0.9.10` and **upgrade your calls to prawn graph to use the new `graph` methods as soon as possible**.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo use prawn-graph, you can add the following to your `Gemfile`:\r\n\r\n```Gemfile\r\n gem 'prawn-graph', ' ~> 1.0'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use Rubygems directly: `gem install prawn-graph`.\r\n \r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nWith thanks to [株式会社アルム][3] ([Allm Inc][4]) for allowing Ryan Stenhouse the time to rebuild this version of\r\nprawn-graph. This updated version of prawn-graph was inspired and guided by [prawn-svg][1] by [Roger Nesbitt][6]. \r\n\r\nPrawn Graph was originally sponsored by and built for use at [Purchasing Card Consultancy Ltd][7] while\r\nRyan Stenhouse was employed there.\r\n\r\n## Supported graph / chart types\r\n\r\nThis version of Prawn::Graph supports the following graph / chart types:\r\n\r\n  *  Bar Charts \r\n  *  Line Charts\r\n\r\nIs your favourite chart type not supported yet? [Please request it][2], or if you are feeling particularly\r\nadventurous - please add it!\r\n\r\n## Using prawn-graph\r\n\r\nGraphs can be created by calling the `graph` or its alias, `chart` method with an array of\r\n`Prawn::Graph::Series` objects representing the data you would like to plot and how it should\r\nbe displayed. It will also take a hash of options, and block which will have the graph yeilded\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  graph data, options = {}, &block.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen called with just a set of data, prawn-graph will do its best to make the graph fit in the \r\navailable space. For a little more control over how the graphs are rendered in the document\r\nyou can pass the following options to `graph` or `chart`:\r\n\r\nOption      | Data type | Description\r\n----------- | --------- | -----------\r\n:at         | [integer, integer] | Specify the location on the page you want the graph to appear.\r\n:width      | integer   | Desired width of the graph.  Defaults to horizontal space available.\r\n:height     | integer   | Desired height of the graph.  Defaults to vertical space available.\r\n:title      | string    | The overall title for your chart\r\n:series_key | boolean   | Should we render the series key for multi series graphs? Defaults to true.\r\n\r\nThe `data` passed to `graph` or `chart` should be an `Array` of `Prawn::Graph::Series` objects, which\r\nthemselves are made up of an array of data points to plot, and a series of options.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  Prawn::Graph::Series.new [1,2,3,4], options = {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nValid `options` are:\r\n\r\nOption        | Data type | Description\r\n------------- | --------- | -----------\r\n:mark_average | boolean   | Should we mark a line showing the average value of the series? Defaults to false.\r\n:mark_minimum | boolean   | Should we mark the minimum value of the series? Defaults to false.\r\n:mark_maximum | boolean   | Should we mark the maximum value of the series? Defaults to false.\r\n:title        | string    | The title of this series, which will be shown in the series key.\r\n:type         | symbol    | How this series should be rendered. Defaults to `:bar`, valid options are `:bar`, `:line`.\r\n\r\n### Show me some code!\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  require 'prawn-graph'\r\n\r\n  series = []\r\n  series << Prawn::Graph::Series.new([4,9,3,2,1,6,2,8,2,3,4,9,2],  title: \"A label for a series\", type: :bar)\r\n  series << Prawn::Graph::Series.new([5,4,3,2,7,9,2,8,7,5,4,9,2],  title: \"Another label\", type: :line, mark_average: true, mark_minimum: true)\r\n  series << Prawn::Graph::Series.new([1,2,3,4,5,9,6,4,5,6,3,2,11], title: \"Yet another label\", type: :bar)\r\n  series << Prawn::Graph::Series.new([1,2,3,4,5,12,6,4,5,6,3,2,9].shuffle, title: \"One final label\", type: :line, mark_average: true, mark_maximum: true)\r\n\r\n  xaxis_labels = ['0900', '1000', '1100', '1200', '1300', '1400', '1500', '1600', '1700', '1800', '1900', '2000', '2100']\r\n\r\n  Prawn::Document.generate('test.pdf') do\r\n    graph series, width: 500, height: 200, title: \"A Title for the chart\", at: [10,700], xaxis_labels: xaxis_labels\r\n  end\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Output\r\n<img src=\"http://prawn-graph.ryanstenhouse.jp/img/prawn-graph-output.png\" alt=\"Prawn Graph Example Output\" width=\"933\" height=\"420\">\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nAfter checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can\r\nalso  run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.\r\n\r\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the \r\nversion number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, \r\npush git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome [on GitHub][2].
