## Acknowledgements

With thanks to [株式会社アルム][3] ([Allm Inc][4]) for allowing Ryan Stenhouse the time to rebuild this version of
prawn-graph. This updated version of prawn-graph was inspired and guided by [prawn-svg][1] by [mogest][1].

## Compatibility

The gem is  only tested against Ruby version 2.0 and greater. Older Ruby versions may work but are not 
officially supported. We aim for compatibilty with 1.0 and 2.0 series of prawn. Any incomaptibilities
should be treated as bugs and added to the [issue tracker][2]. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can
also  run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the 
version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, 
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
